                    * Face Mask Detection System :<br><br>
                    &nbsp This was the project me and my friends made for our college project in this our <br>
                    &nbsp objective was to detect whether the person facing a camera is wearing a mask or not.<br>
                    &nbsp This project was based on python programming language. Thsi is the project <br>
                    &nbsp We made in the time when the college just reopened and all the students were <br>
                    &nbsp supposed to wear mask inside the campus. So for the ease of the security gaurds <br>
                    &nbsp So that they need not to ask every person entering the gate of building. This <br>
                    &nbsp system helps as it can be integrated in the cameras and it can be very useful <br>
                    &nbsp in hospitals also. <br><br>

                    &nbsp Amazon Prime is a ott platform which provides the entertainment content. In <br>
                    &nbsp this project I made exact replica of The prime login page. This project was <br>
                    &nbsp done with the help of html and css. <br><br>
                    * Intrusion Detection System : <br><br>
                    &nbsp This project was based on the subject of Computer Networks. This project was <br>
                    &nbsp done on Cisco Packet Tracer. In this we have used multiple systems and servers <br>
                    &nbsp which keeps track of all the intrusion from the ip addresses outside of the <br>
                    &nbsp specified network. <br><br>

                    &nbsp my skills on C++. This project manages the record of the students and their <br>
                    &nbsp performances of the students in the tests and their fees details. This site <br>
                    &nbsp also stores the details of the students. <br><br>

                    &nbsp This game is the one who haven't played in their life. This was the most popular <br>
                    &nbsp game during our childhood. This project I made with the help of my friend and <br>
                    &nbsp made this nostalgic game with the help of Python. <br><br>
